Modification or use of these Terms and McDonald’s Philippines Privacy Policy for any other purpose violates McDonald’s Philippines intellectual property rights.
            
            When an Online Service requires or includes downloadable software, the software, including all files or images contained in or generated by the software, and accompanying data (together, the “Software”) are deemed to be licensed to you by McDonald’s Philippines, it being understood that such license shall be personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and revocable. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the Online Services.

            Independence of Franchisees. While GADC operates and controls the Online Services, it is not responsible for the operation of ALL McDonald’s restaurants in the Philippines.
